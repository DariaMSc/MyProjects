# MyProjects
My projects in data analytics &amp; data science.
Projects' summary: 

Group project in Python “Using online prices for measuring real consumption across countries. Russia and the UK” (2021)
- Task: get online data for electronics and beverages and calculate PPP between the UK and Russia using World Bank Methodology 
- Skills required: Web-scraping, Python (numpy, matplotlib, pandas), Data Processing, Data Aggregation, Statistics & Econometrics
- Techniques used: Hedonic Regression
- Results: Fisher-type PPP is 77.77, PLI is 0.76 on aggregated level in the UK base prices - > discrepancy of PPP and official currency exchange rate indicates the macroeconomic differences between countries, such as GPD gap, lower purchasing power and cost of labor.

Individual project in Python “Why are the best and most experienced employees leaving the company prematurely?” (2022)
- Task: predict which employee will leave the company next using ML algorithms
- Skills required: Data Processing, Statistics & Econometrics, Python
- Techniques used: linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning
- Results: The model is able to identify that an employee will leave the company in 97% of cases (Recall).

Individual project in R “What factors can explain excess mortality in Germany in 2019-2021?” (2022)
- Task: create research design, calculate excess mortality, collect the relevant data that can explain excess mortality, apply econometric tools to build suitable regression framework, check resuts' robustness
- Skills required: research design, Statistics & Econometrics, Data Processing, Data Cleaning, R-Programming
- Techniques used: linear regression with interaction term, IV regression
- Results: excess mortality in Germany in 2019-2021 can be primarily explained by COVID-19 cases, Age and monthly Weather Temperature. The results are robust and significant at 1% level. I also controlled for vaccination rate, federal states, counties and rain. Suprisingly, there is no relationship between excess mortality and vaccination rate of the population, presumably, due to lack of the more detailed data on deaths.
